        <header>
            <h1>This is the <em>best</em> motherfucking website.</h1>
            <aside>Really, it is.</aside>
        </header>
        
        <h2>Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website doesn't need some styling?</h2>
        
        <p>You probably build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB <span class='rouge'>motherfuckingwebsite</span>(.com) is going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your fucking default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.</p>
        <p><span class='wrong'>WRONG</span>, motherfucker.</p>
        
        <h2>The best kick-ass website</h2>
        <p>Let me describe the <em>real</em> perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past <span class='rouge'>motherfuckingwebsites</span>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)</li>
            <li>The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the <a href="https://google.com/">Google home page</a></li>
            <li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your damn 16x32 Tamagotchi)</li>
            <li>Looks <i>almost</i> the same on every screen</li>
            <li>Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem <small>well, kind of</small></li>
            <li>It's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">accessible</a>, so everyone can enjoy it <small>but not everyone can read this - this text is Ant-Accessible</small></li>
            <li>Shit is <i>even more</i> legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style without looking like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a> website</li>
            <li>Use <i>some</i> fucking <span class="colored" id="rbw" style="color: rgb;">colors</span>.</li>
            <li>Links don't really need to keep that <span class="sb">shitty blue</span> the browser is giving them: nor that <span class="vc">violetish color</span> when they are marked as visited. Just give them a nice color</li>
            <li>It uses some cool technologies like JavaScript <img src="js.png" title="JavaScript logo" class="logo">, CSS3 <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/CSS3_logo_and_wordmark.svg/363px-CSS3_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png" title="CSS3 logo" class="logo"> and HTML5 <img src="html5.png" title="HTML5 Logo" class="logo"></li>
        </ul>
        
       <h2>Put some pictures</h2>
        <div class="fancyPositioning"><div class="picture-left"><img src="Lapin-belier2.jpg" title="A nice and cute rabbit" /><p class="caption">A rabbit, just to keep the context of the website.</p></div><div class="tleft"><p>We're not looking at a novel by Stephanie Meyer, this is a <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite</span> so include some pictures to give a context.</p><p>The website shouldn't be overfilled with pictures, but it should make the user happy while reading your nonsense words.</p><p>You see that fancy cat? He's happy, you should be too.</p></div></div>
        
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <h2>Yes, even this is satire.</h2>

        <p>But this doesn't mean you should load your <span class="rouge">motherfuckingwebsite</span> with shitty animations, instead keep it simple, minify its resources and use images responsibly. Remember the IPoAC users!</p>
        <blockquote><span>Good design is as little design as possible.</span><author>Some German motherfucker on motherfuckingwebsite.com</author></blockquote>

        <p>That's not entirely true, look at that <span class="rouge">motherfuckingwebsite</span>. It's so minimal that it can be considered crap.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Epilogue</h2>
        <p>Actually this website was made to follow the trend of the <span class="rouge">motherfuckingwebsite</span> and the <span class="rouge">bettermotherfuckingwebsite</span>.</p>
        <p>Despite what was said here they're beautiful and truly among the best websites on the internet (even though this is still thebestmotherfuckingwebsite), so go check 'em out.</p>
        <p>Seriously, follow some of the advice we gave you, they'll "make the web great again" <span class="expo">Cit. needed</span></p>
